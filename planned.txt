=== Planned

* implement byte code awareness
  * add the byte code sequences to the methods so it can be analysed later (see JVM spec) 
  * scanning of byte code for numbers, which methods loaded, which fields loaded

* test with a large set of classes
  * use all classes of all JDKs against javap (compileTheWorld)
  * use the Quality Corpus
