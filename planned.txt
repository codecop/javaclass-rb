=== Planned

* deployment
  * Migrate to rubygems
  * automate deyployment

* create a favicon for api and project (BCEL with R?)

* implement
  * isAnnotation (checks version>=5 & superclass)
    * are Annotation extendable, if so how do they look? (javap)
  * isEnum (checks version>=5 & superclass)
    * are Enums extendable (yes), if so how do they look? (javap)
  * scanning of byte code for numbers, which methods loaded, which fields loaded 

* analyse
  * how do Scala classes look like? sth special?

* test
  * test with all classes of all JDKs against javap from this version "compileTheWorld"

* think about
  * add zip gem to load classes directly from the classpath (i.e. the jars), add gem dependency
    * classpath abstraction, classpath contains list of JARs, folders, ZIPs
    * WARs and EARs contain JARs and folders
    * compare against my old Java implementation
