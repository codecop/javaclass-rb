=== Planned

* add collecting of incoming references (mark my interfaces, mark my referenced classes)
  * can calculate stability
  * find interfaces with only 1 implementation (smell?)

* implement byte code awareness
  * add the byte code sequences to the methods so it can be analysed later (see JVM spec) 
  * scanning of byte code for numbers, which methods loaded, which fields loaded

* test with a large set of classes
  * use all classes of all JDKs against javap (compileTheWorld)
  * use the Quality Corpus
