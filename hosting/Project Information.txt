Name:
Java Class File Parser for Ruby

Description:
<<<
==Description==
javaclass-rb (Java Class File Parser for Ruby) is a
parser and disassembler for Java class files, similar to the javap command.
It provides access to the package, protected, and public fields and methods
of the classes passed to it together with a list of all outgoing references.
This might be the base for some serious static code analysis tools. (I
started adding methods to that end...)

==Goals==
 * searching and accessing class files
 * parsing meta data of class files
 * displaying this meta data
 * analysing the structure of class files (down to field/method level)
 * calculating numbers based on this structure
 * calculating higher metrics
 * "static code analysis"

==Non Goals==
 * parsing the actual byte code
 * verifying byte code
 * generating byte code
 * generating class files
 * executing byte code

==Documentation==
Module `JavaClass` is the entry point for most functions in the gem. The main class is `JavaClass::ClassFile::JavaClassHeader` which provides access to all information of a Java class file. Read the [http://api.javaclass-rb.googlecode.com/hg/index.html API RDoc].
