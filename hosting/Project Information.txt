Code:
javaclass-rb

Name:
Java Class File Parser for Ruby

Description:
Parser and disassembler for Java class files, similar to the javap command.
It provides access to the package, protected, and public fields and methods
of the classes passed to it together with a list of all outgoing references.
This might be the base for some serious static code analysis tools. (I
started adding methods to that end...)
